# TheDailyCommit
1/4/17- First Day
Hopefully this will be the first in a more than year long daily upload of code/brainstorm of ideas to a project that I am
working on to compile a web app that includes a database that will allow any student at Rockhurst High School, using his 
netclassroom login credentials, to access the database. Hopefully I will add features like the ability to view your friends 
schedule's, what free's teachers have to allow you to better collaborate during school, and better make use of the new free
periods implemented this year.
